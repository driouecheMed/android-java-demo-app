Thank you for considering contributing to this repository! We welcome all contributions from the community, whether they are code contributions, bug reports, feature requests, or anything else.


## How to contribute

1. Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
2. Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
3. Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
4. If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
5. Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `main`.
6. Create new project or update existing project.
7. Add your project with screenshots to the repo README.
8. Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
9. From your fork open a pull request to the `main` branch.
10. If the maintainer requests further changes just push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
11. Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).


Thank you for your contributions!
